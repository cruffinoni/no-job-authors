	<description>Unfinished bills are no longer tied to one pawn. Any eligible colonist can pick them up and finish them.
Safe to add to existing saves.
Safe to remove mid-save.
If removed mid-save, existing unfinished work can still be completed by other eligible pawns.
New unfinished work created after removal follows vanilla authorship behavior.
